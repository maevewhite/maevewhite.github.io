        <section class="implicit-bias">
            <h2>What is Implicit Bias?</h2>
            <p>
              Implicit Bias occurs when we have attitudes or beliefs toward's certain people with associated
              stereotypes without our conscious knowledge. Often, people don't even realize our minds lean towards a
              certain way.
            </p>
            <p>
              By understanding and addressing our implicit biases, we can work harder at a more equitable and inclusive society.

            <h2>What is Intersectionality?</h2>
            <p>
              <!-- Find out if there is a better way to site this-->
                Patricia Hill Collins and Sirma Bilge describe Intersectionality as such:
                <ul>
                  <li> "Intersectionality is a way of understanding and analyzing the complexity in the world, in people, and in human experiences. The events and conditions of social and political life and the self can seldom be
                    understood as shaped by one factor. They are generally shaped by many factors in diverse and mutually influencing ways. When it comes to social inequality, people's lives and the organization of power in a given society
                    are better understood as being shaped not by a given society are better understood as being shaped not by a single axis of social division, be it race or gender or class, but by many axes that work together and influence each other.
                    Intersectionality as an analytical tool gives people better access to the compexity of the world and themselves."</li>
                  </ul>
            <p>
                I think of intersectionality as a pie chart of all of the different parts that make up a person, including race, gender, class, etc.
                All of these different parts of a person are so important because it is what makes each person unique. You cannot just look at one part of a person; You must use how these parts work together to shape one's life.
