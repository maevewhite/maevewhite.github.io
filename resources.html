            <h2>What is Implicit Bias?</h2>
            <p>
              Implicit Bias occurs when we have attitudes or beliefs toward's certain people with associated
              stereotypes without our conscious knowledge. Often, people don't even realize our minds lean towards a
              certain way.
            </p>
            <p>
              By understanding and addressing our implicit biases, we can work harder at a more equitable and inclusive society.

            <h2>What is Intersectionality?</h2>
            <p>
              <!-- Find out if there is a better way to site this-->
                Patricia Hill Collins and Sirma Bilge describe Intersectionality as such:
                <ul>
                  <li> "Intersectionality is a way of understanding and analyzing the complexity in the world, in people, and in human experiences. The events and conditions of social and political life and the self can seldom be
                    understood as shaped by one factor. They are generally shaped by many factors in diverse and mutually influencing ways. When it comes to social inequality, people's lives and the organization of power in a given society
                    are better understood as being shaped not by a given society are better understood as being shaped not by a single axis of social division, be it race or gender or class, but by many axes that work together and influence each other.
                    Intersectionality as an analytical tool gives people better access to the compexity of the world and themselves."</li>
                  </ul>
            <p>
                I think of intersectionality as a pie chart of all of the different parts that make up a person- race, gender, class, and other characteristics that shape who they are.
                All of these different parts of a person are so important because it is what makes each person unique. You cannot just look at one part of a person; You must use how these parts work together to shape one's life.
                In the tech world, intersectionality plays a huge role in understanding why certain groups are underrepresented. It is not just because someone may be a woman or a person of color, yet how being a woman or person of color, along 
                with socioeconomic background, can affect someone's experience at work.

      <h2>Glossary Relating to Implicit Bias and Intersectionality</h2>
      <ul class="definitions-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Bias: </strong>
          Bias is a tendency to lean in a certain direction, based on preconceived notions that are not necessarily based on objective data and information.  In other words, bias means having a misguided
          preference for or against something or someone.

        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Equality: </strong>
          When applying this definition to social structures — like education, politics, and government — equality means that all segments of society have the same level of support and opportunity. This
          means that regardless of one’s gender, race, sex, religion, etc., opportunities remain the same. It ensures that people in different social statuses or groups will not be discriminated against.

        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Equity: </strong>
          In education and social structures, equity refers to the fact that different people have varying needs of support and assistance. Therefore, systems exist to be able to support individuals based on their specific needs.
          <a href="https://www.uopeople.edu/blog/equity-vs-equality/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=ggl-display_pmax_us&utm_term={adid}&utm_content=&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjwjY64BhCaARIsAIfc7YYjnbNoDxqqa1Tv2Cln3XGiwv0yFCatTxT2qKuxhXZgyKsebaVd0YoaAo5lEALw_wcB" target="_blank">[Source: University of the People]</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Oppression: </strong>
          The Smithsonian National Museum of African American History & Culture defines oppression as ‘a combination of prejudice and institutional power that creates a system that regularly and severely discriminates
          against some groups and benefits other groups – A person of the non-dominant group can experience oppression in the form of limitations, disadvantages, or disapproval. They may even suffer abuse from individuals,
          institutions, or cultural practices.

        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Power: </strong>
          Power is the ability to influence and make decisions that impact others. This might include access to services, resources, goods, and more. This can be positional power within an organization because an individual
          has influence as a leader in the organization. Or, this can be relational or situational power where an individual has access to influence people, decision-making processes, policy, and more. And that is every single
          person in an organization because we call have some level of influence on systems, structures, and people. What do you have power to influence?

        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Privilege: </strong>
          "Privilege" refers to certain social advantages, benefits, or degrees of prestige and respect that an individual has by virtue of belonging to certain social identity groups. Within American and other
          Western societies, these privileged social identities—of people who have historically occupied positions of dominance over others—include whites, males, heterosexuals, Christians, and the weathy, among others.
