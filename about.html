        I am currently a student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison,
        majoring in Information Science with certificates in Data Science and
        Digital Studies. My passion lies in connecting with others and solving problems in a way that
        feels both thoughtful and practical. Whether I’m working on a team project with classmates,
        building relationships with coworkers, or diving into the fast-paced world of technology,
        I approach every interaction with enthusiasm and curiosity.

        What excites me most is the opportunity to learn from
        people with diverse backgrounds and experiences. I enjoy making
        others feel heard and valued, and I take pride in bringing creative solutions
        to the table—whether I’m analyzing data, visualizing insights, or collaborating
        with others to solve complex problems. My background in data visualization, SQL,
        Python, and Java gives me the tools to dive deep into analytics, while my experiences
        in sales and teamwork help me foster meaningful connections and achieve shared goals.</p>
        <p>
        As I look ahead to life after graduation, I’m excited to blend my technical skills with
        my love for people, whether that’s through sales or an analytical role. I believe that at
        the heart of any successful venture is communication—listening, engaging, and problem-solving—and
        I’m eager to bring these strengths into my future career, helping organizations grow and succeed.
